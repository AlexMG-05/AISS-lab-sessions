# AISS Practical Sessions

Proposed solution code for practical exercises from Architecture and Integration of Software Systems course at [Universidad de Sevilla](https://www.us.es/)

These exercises work with API's operations such as GET. You can work with several APIs from different apps or services like GitHub, Spotify, SpaceX and so on.

Classes were generated as POJO files at [jsonschema2pojo](https://www.jsonschema2pojo.org/) and projects were initialized using [Spring](https://start.spring.io/), although you can set it up yourself with IntelliJ IDE.
